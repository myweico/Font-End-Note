有效且结构良好的文档为你要应用的样式提供了一个框架，若要对某一元素使用某个样式，则需要某些选择该元素的规则，这就是选择器。

## Selection
- univesal
    - `* {sRules}`
- element
    - `E {sRules}`
- class
    - `.class {sRules}`
- ID
    - `#ID {sRules} `
- Relation:
    - `E1 E2`, Descendant Combinator
    - `E1 > E2`, Child Combinator
    - `E1 + E2`, Adjacent Sibling Combinator
    - `E1 ~ E2`, General Sibling Combinator
- Attribution:
    - `E[attr]`, combinate the element with attr
    - `E[attr = "value"]`, combinate the element with attr which is value
    - `E[attr ~= "value"]`, combinate a element with attr, and its attr list contain value(space split)
    - `E[attr |= "value"]`, combinate a element with attr, and its attr list splited with "-" bigins with value
    - `E[attr ^= "value"]`, combinate a element with attr, and its attr's prefix contains value
    - `E[attr $= "value"]`, combinate a element with attr, and attr's suffix contains value
    - `E[attr *="value"]`, combinate a element with attr, and attr contains string value
- Pseudo-Classes Selectors
    - `E:link`, set the style for links which have not been visited
    - `E:visited`, set the style for links that have been visited
    - `E:hover`, set the style for the element when the cursor hovering above it
    - `E:active`, set the style for the element when cliking the mouse
- Strcutrual Pseudo-Class Selectors
    - `E:root`
    - `E:nth-child(n)`,parent's nth child,1,2,3,2n+1,2n,odd,even
    - `E:nth-last-child(n)`, same as the nth-child(n) but the sequence is reversed
    - `E:nth-of-type(n)`,parent's nth E type,1,2,3,2n,2n+1,odd,even
    - `E:nth-last-of-type(n)`
    - `E:first-child`
    - `E:last-child`
    - `E:first-of-type`
    - `E:last-of-type`
    - `E:only-chlid`, select the elements, which only contain one child E
    - `E:only-of-type`, select the elements,which only contain one type E
- UI Element States Pseudo-Classes Selectors
    - `E:enabled`
    - `E:diabled`
    - `E:checked`
- Not Pseudo-Classes Selectors
    - `E:not(s)`
- Group Selectors
    - `E1, E2, E3 {sRules};`

when it set \<a\> color, all the effect of pseudo of a tag will lose efficacy
#### Why call it pseudo classes?  
Because it look like a class,and you can't find it in your HTML file.  
Taking E:link as example, at first, brower will scan the link and find out which have not been visited, the browser will divide these into the unvisited category and the corresponding css takes effect.

#### Why it is called Cascading Style Sheet?
- Becase it has different kinds of style sheet and they all have priority, authors > users > defaults
- And the repetive style will be cover too

#### The pocess of finding the style of \<h1\>'s font-size
1. Collecting all the style sheets（!u>!a>a>u>d）
2. Get all style about \<h1\> font-size 
3. Sorting by defaults, authors and users
4. Sorting by the priority
5. The hignest priority decide the font size of \<h1\>,if it has a conflict, the
last has the higher priority
 

#### How to know the priority?
1. 3 figures 0(a) 0(b) 0(c)
2. id:a++, class:b++, elem name:c++

**others**  
- user can use `!important`to cover author's css
